# Bens_Adventure
Ben is a businessman who wants to travel to the south east Asia countries to make investment.  
The countries(cities to be more specific) are:  
- Kuala Lumpur(Starting and ending point)
- Bangkok
- Beijing
- Hong Kong
- Jakarta
- Tokyo
- Seoul
- Taipei

Using algorithm such as Held-Karp, the shortest path going through each cities once is determined.  
A sentiment value path is also created by using string matching algorithm(Rabin-Karp and Tries) to analysed articels collected regarding each city.  

To run the program make sure to install the following modules in python;
- Plotly
- Gmplot
- Geopy


Running the file:
- Open "Ben Adventure.py" and run
- after running the file, the code will be executed and htmls will be created that contain the map of the path that Ben should take(shortest path, sentiment value path and optimised path).
- also there will be a htmls flder that contains all the barchart(generated by plotly) regarding the frequency of words of the city and the frequency of positive, negative and neutral words of each city.\
